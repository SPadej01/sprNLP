        This function defines the computation inside `call` with projected
        multi-head Q, K, V inputs. Users can override this function for
        customized attention implementation.

        Args:
            query: Projected query tensor of shape `(B, T, N, key_dim)`.
            key: Projected key tensor of shape `(B, S, N, key_dim)`.
            value: Projected value tensor of shape `(B, S, N, value_dim)`.
            attention_mask: a boolean mask of shape `(B, T, S)`, that prevents
                attention to certain positions. It is generally not needed if
                the `query` and `value` (and/or `key`) are masked.
            training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave
                in training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (doing
                nothing).

        Returns:
          attention_output: Multi-headed outputs of attention computation.
          attention_scores: Multi-headed attention weights.
