    This function defines the computation inside `call` with projected
    multi-head Q, K, V inputs. Users can override this function for
    customized attention implementation.

    Args:
        query: Projected query tensor of shape `(B, T, N, key_dim)`.
        key: Projected key tensor of shape `(B, S, N, key_dim)`.
        value: Projected value tensor of shape `(B, S, N, value_dim)`.
        attention_mask: a boolean mask of shape `(B, T, S)`, that prevents
            attention to certain positions. It is generally not needed if
            the `query` and `value` (and/or `key`) are masked.
        training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave
            in training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (doing
            nothing).

    Returns:
      attention_output: Multi-headed outputs of attention computation.
      attention_scores: Multi-headed attention weights.
